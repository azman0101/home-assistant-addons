# Addon repository

This repository contains all the addons I've created for home-assistant. It can be added to your home assistant instance copying it's github URL to the "repository" form in the addon page (top right three dots)

## Available addons

### hass-backup-s3

Backup your home assistant backups to a s3 bucket (support local first encryption through GPG)

### hass-deepstack

Deploy a deepstack server directly into home assistant (beware of the resources consumption)

### hass-n8n

Deploy a n8n instance directly into home-assistant
> original n8n versions are automatically followed

### hass-jellyfin

Deploy a Jellyfin media server directly into home-assistant.
> It's a very very basic implementation, little to no customization. Should still work out of box

## Issues

Please open issues into child repositories, not on this one. Thanks !
